# IAITB Baseball Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **performance of the IAITB (Ikatan Alumni Institut Teknologi Bandung) Baseball Team**. Using both historical performance data and detailed game statistics, the analysis provides insights into **player performance, team strategies, and game outcomes**.  

The datasets contain season summaries and specific match plans (including Jakarta tournaments), which are explored through statistical analysis and visualization in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Sources**  
   - `Summary IAITB.xlsx`: Aggregated summary of IAITB baseball team performance across games and tournaments.  
   - `Catalyst Dominates Jakarta Initial Plan (1).xlsx`: Detailed dataset on a Jakarta tournament case study and initial planning data.  

2. **Notebook Analysis (`IAITB.ipynb`)**  
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting game statistics).  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify performance trends.  
   - Player-level analysis: batting averages, pitching effectiveness, and fielding stats.  
   - Team-level performance trends across seasons and tournaments.  

3. **Tools & Techniques**  
   - Python (Jupyter Notebook) for statistical analysis and visualization.  
   - Excel datasets for structured team records and planning.
